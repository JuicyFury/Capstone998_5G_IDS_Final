# CSIT998 – 5G Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 📘 Overview
This project, developed as part of the University of Wollongong’s CSIT998 Professional Capstone, implements a Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System for 5G network traffic simulated using NS-3.

The solution integrates network traffic generation, feature extraction, and classification modules to detect potential intrusions efficiently.
